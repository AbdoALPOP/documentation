# Custom translations

All UI components can be translated into any language. The translated texts can be managed via ROQ's console or your
existing translation system.

## Managing translations

By default, translations are managed via our console. All components are already translated. Therefore you can find the
translated texts and change them to your needs. Changes will be shown in the UI components after a few minutes because
of the browser's caching system.

## Managing locales

You can add a new locale in the console.
{/* TODO add screenshot */}

## Loading translations in code

Locales are defined as a prop of `<RoqProvider>`. If no locale is defined, then en-US will be used as the default
locale.

```tsx
<RoqProvider locale="de-DE">

</RoqProvider>
```

The `<RoqProvider>` fetches translations from ROQ Platform every five minutes. The data is cached in the user's browser.
You can configure the interval here: TODO.

## Custom translation provider

If you are already using a translation system, you can pass a function that takes over the translation.
```tsx
return (
    <RoqProvider translation={myTranslation}>
        {Story()}
    </RoqProvider>
);
```
