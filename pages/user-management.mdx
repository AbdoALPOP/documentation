# User Management

## Introduction

ROQ provides a complete solution for user management. With ROQ, you can:

* protect your web application with login and registration ([authentication](/authentication))
* group users into tenants ([multi-tenancy](/multi-tenancy))
* invite other users ([user invites](/user-invites))
* notify your users via various channels ([notifications](/notifications))
* define roles and permissions for users ([access management](/access-management))
* login to [ROQ Console](https://console.roq.tech/) and see all data which is related to a user

## User sync

In case you want to keep your existing authentication system, then you need to synchronize some user data, which is
required by other features of ROQ. See instructions [here](/user-management/advanced/sync-user).
