## Basic concepts

| Concept          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                |

| File visibility  | A file can be either public or private. Public means that there is a permanent URL which can be used by anyone, while private files can only be accessed by user who are allowed to do so. |
| File categories  | Often it makes sense to group files into project-specific categories, like “USER_FILES” or “CONTRACT_FILES”                                                                                |
| Content types    | The list of all available types is available here: :question:                                                                                                                              |
| File status      | The status of a file which can be one of: UPLOAD_PENDING, READY, CANCELLED or ERROR                                                                                                        |
| File association | When a file is stored on ROQ Platform, then it always belongs to another entity. For instance PDF files can be uploaded and related to a contract:                                         |
