# Files

## Introduction

ROQ provides a complete solution for file management including these features:

* File upload using the UI component
* Files visiblity (public or private)
* File associations (files can be related to any object)

## UI Components

{/* TODO */}

ROQ’s file management provides there UI components which can be integrated into your application:

1. The [File Upload UI component](/ui-components/file-upload) represents an area on your application where users
  can drag and drop files to be uploaded.
2. TODO

## Basic concepts

### File uploads

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Files that are uploaded to ROQ Platform are stored on [Scaleway Object Storage](https://www.scaleway.com/en/object-storage/). The data center is located in Paris. 
</Callout>

Files can be uploaded via [File Upload UI component](/ui-components/file-upload) or programmatically using the
[createFileUpload() API](/api-doc/files-api#createfileupload). The upload is realized using signed URLs, which means the 
files are uploaded directly from the user's browser to the object storage without sending it through your backend.

### File status



### File categories

### File visibility

A file can be either public or private. Public means that there is a permanent URL which can be used by anyone, while
private files can only be accessed by user who are allowed to do so. The visibility of a file can be changed in the
console or via API ([docs](/api-doc/files/change-visibility)).

### File ownership and access management

### File associations

When a file is stored on ROQ Platform, then it always belongs to another entity. For instance PDF files can be uploaded
and related to a contract:

| File categories  | Often it makes sense to group files into project-specific categories, like “USER_FILES” or “CONTRACT_FILES”                                                                                |
| Content types    | The list of all available types is available here: :question:                                                                                                                              |
| File status      | The status of a file which can be one of: UPLOAD_PENDING, READY, CANCELLED or ERROR                                                                                                        |
