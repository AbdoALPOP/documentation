# User groups

## Introduction

We usually interpret a user group as exactly what the name says: _“a group of users”_. The most common use case is to
use
user groups to represent [Multi-tenancy](/feature-guides/multi-tenancy) but there are also lots of other use cases. You
may want to group users by their home country or any other characteristic.

User groups are often related to your custom domain objects like:
* all users that belong to a restaurant
* all users that belong to a team
* all users that belong to a company

User groups are used for multiple purposes:
* to notify a group of users
* to define access rights, eg:
  * users of the same restaurant can chat with each other
  * this file can be edited by all users of the same team
  * users of the company can invite each other

## Manage user groups
User groups can be managed via [console]() or [Create user group API](). A user group has a **name** (e.g. _“The Mavericks”_ or _“The
Gourmet Kitchen”_). In addition, you can define a project-specific **reference** that enables you to fetch user groups using
your own identifier. User groups are having a **type**. For instance _“The Mavericks”_ could be of type _“Team”_, while _“Foo
Global”_ could be of type _“Restaurant”_.

## Add and remove users
You can add and remove users from a user group in the [console]() or use the [Add users to a user group API](). Group
memberships are also shown for each user in the console.
