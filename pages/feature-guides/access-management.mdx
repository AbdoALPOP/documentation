# Access Management

## Introduction

Access management in SaaS applications refers to controlling who can access the application and what actions they can
perform. This is achieved through roles and permissions, which grant different access levels to other users.

With ROQ's access management, you can:

* define roles and assign them to your users
* setup permissions and enforce them on your application.

## What are roles and permissions?

A **role** is represented by its name. For example, you may define a role called "admin" and another role called "
member". You can also be more specific and use whatever term makes sense in your business, like "chef", "driver", or
just "customer".

Conceptually a role is a set of **permissions**. Roles are assigned directly to users. In some scenarios, users have
multiple roles.

You can easily read them in sentences like this:

* A user is an admin
* A user is a chef
* A user is a driver

**Permissions** define access to a specific type of object. For instance, you specify that a user has “read” access to
the sales orders of a restaurant management software.

## How it works

Roles and permissions are defined in the console. Generally, permissions grant access to objects, e.g., "a user is
allowed to make an order". You can specify the access level (read, create, update and delete) and set the scope. The
scope determines if a user has access to either "all" records, only the own records, or to records related to users of a
user group. These permissions are automatically enforced on all UI Components and APIs of ROQ.

Some steps of preparation are needed. First, you must declare your custom domain objects with relations in the console and define your
permissions based on these objects.

Technically the access management works based on a query plan which ROQ computes based on the current user's
roles&permissions and your objects&relations. The SDK is caching this information locally and only refreshes it
periodically. This way, your application is independent of the availability of the ROQ Platform. Furthermore, there is
no need to send all your data. ROQ only needs to know the schema of your database; the actual queries will be performed
on your side.

You can use two functions of the SDK in your project: `hasAccess` and `buildQueryPlan`

## Check if a user has access to an object.

The hasAccess method returns true if a user has access to something; otherwise false. You can use it for any object,
whether it's an entity from your database, a URL, or a user interface component. See hasAccess SDK for more details.

## Filter down data of a query

When you retrieve data from your database, you'll often need to filter it by the user's role. For example, let’s say you
have a REST endpoint called /rented-cars which returns a list of rented cars. Depending on the user's role, the 
result will be different: an "admin" will see all the rented cars, while a regular user will see only their 
rented cars. This can result in complicated WHERE conditions, especially if you have more than these two simple roles.

For this scenario, ROQ provides a query builder that automatically creates the required conditions. Using our ORM
adapter, this can be easily integrated into your project. The generated queries can become quite complex if you have a
deep schema. You can read more details about this method here: buildQueryPlan SDK

## Managing roles

A role has a name and a reference. The name should describe the role in an understandable way, like "admin", "chef" or "
driver". We recommend using the terminology of your business to avoid confusion.

Roles can be managed in ROQ's console.

## Defining permissions

Permissions are defined for each role individually. How you configure permissions varies depending on whether they are
applied on your project side or at ROQ, but you'll still use the same roles for both systems.

### Project's permissions

To define permission for your own application, you need to select an object type (e.g., salesOrder). If you don't find
the required object in the dropdown, then it wasn't declared in the preparation. In this case, please refer to the
integration guide: Access Management - Project Integration

For each object, you can set the access level:

| Level  | Description                                                 |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Read   | The user is allowed to retrieve objects                     |
| Create | Enables the user to create new objects of the selected type |
| Update | Enables the user to update objects of the selected type     |
| Delete | Enables the user to delete objects of the selected type     |

In addition you can define the scope:

| Scope      | Description                               |
|------------|-------------------------------------------|
| All        | The user is allowed to access all records |
| Restricted | A given path restricts the access         |

The **path** defines the correct way from one database table to another. For example, the path always starts at the
table representing the user (often, this table is called user ). From here, you can select other tables that are
related until you reach the table that holds objects of the selected type. For instance, a path to a sales order
object could look like this: `user → salesOrder`. A path from a user to an order item could look like
this: `user -> salesOrder -> salesOrderItem`

{/* The console will automatically set this information if the path is clear. You only need to adopt it if there are
multiple paths in your schema. */}


Your custom database schema only defines these paths. Instead, ROQ uses them to build the query plan, which is then used
to add WHERE conditions to your database queries.

## ROQ Platform permissions

Permissions that are applied on ROQ's side are defined similarly. The paths are already pre-defined, so you don't need
to set them up, but the scope needs to be defined differently.

Scopes:

| Scope  | Description                                                             |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| All    | The user is allowed to access all records                               |
| Own    | The access is restricted to records that are directly related to a user |
| Tenant | TODO                                                                    |
