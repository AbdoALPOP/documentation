# Users

## Introduction

Most of ROQ's features use user-related data like the user`s first name or email. Before you can use these
features, they need to be pushed to ROQ Platform.

The data is needed for two purposes.

* For the creation of user-specific JWT tokens. These tokens are used for secure interaction between your application
  and ROQ.
* The data is also used to send [emails](/feature-guides/mails) and [notifications](/feature-guides/notifications). For
  instance, you may want to address your users by their first name in a notification template: `Hi {{recipient.
  firstName}}`

  It's your decision which information you wish to synchronize to ROQ. It's recommended to send the data to ROQ after
you store it in your database using the [`createUser()`](/api-doc/users-api#createuser) API.
