# Real-time Chat

ROQ’s chat system is a fully fledged messaging interface that enables your app’s users to chat in realtime, or send
messages, similar to popular messenger applications.

The chat system uses a secure websocket socket connection to send and receive messages in realtime. It can be integrated
to your application within a few minutes, and then customized to your requirements. It is highly flexible and using a
combination of the customizable UI widgets for chat, and the API, you could achieve a wide range of flexibility - from a
private messenger like experience, to even a slack-like experience.
