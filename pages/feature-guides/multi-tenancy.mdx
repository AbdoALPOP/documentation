# Multi-tenancy

In B2B SaaS applications, all users are usually grouped into tenants. Each of your business customers is represented as
a tenant. The related users and all the data are fully isolated.

You may use another term, like organization, workspace, or team. For instance, if you are using Slack, then you know
that your team members are grouped into a so-called workspace. A tenant is usually created when the first user signs up,
see [User registration](). The first user then invites other users to the tenant; see [User invitation]()

In ROQ, tenants are represented as [User groups]().
