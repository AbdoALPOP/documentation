# ROQ Provider

## Introduction

To use ROQ's UI Components, you need to wrap your React application into the `<RoqProvider/>` component. This
provider is used for configuration and provides the required context to the other components.

You can install the UI library via NPM:

```shell
npm install @roq/ui-react
```

First, you need to determine the right place to add the wrapper:

- **Pure React:** There is always an entry component, depending on your architecture approach.
- **Next.js:** If using Next.js, then it's recommended to use the App component as described
  here: https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-app

Then you need to import the `index.css`, which holds the styling of ROQâ€™s UI components, and wrap your application into
the `<RoqProvider />`

{/* TODO Replace with working code snippet */}

```tsx
import { RoqProvider } from "@roq/ui-react";
import { getUserToken } from "<..yourlib/auth>";
import "@roq/ui-react/dist/index.css";

function App() {
  const token = getUserToken();

  return (
    <RoqProvider
      config={{
        host: "https://...",
        token,
      }}
    >
      ...
    </RoqProvider>
  );
}
```

There are multiple props and configuration parameters that can be set on the `RoqProvider` component:

| Prop                        | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `debug`                     | boolean  | Attribute to launch RoqProvider in the debug mode. Lifecycle events and the configuration values will be logged into the browser console.                                  |
| `config`                    | object   | An object that sets the global config with the parameters explained below.                                                                                                 |
| `config:host`               | string   | Defines the URL of ROQ Platform. You can get this information from the console. Please note the hostname will be different for production and non-production environments. |

| `config:socket?`            | boolean  | A boolean value must be true if a socket connection is established. This is required for notifications and chats. (default: false)                                         |
| `locale?`                   | string   | The locale prop is used to translate the component. Setting the same locale used in the current user's session is recommended.                                             |
| `theme?`                    | string   | Currently selected theme. All components ship with a light and a dark theme (default: light)                                                                               |
| `customTheme?`              | string   | You can change the styling of the component by injection as a custom theme like this:                                                                                      |
| `config:translationsTTL?`   | number   | Fetched translations are saved in the browser's local storage. This parameter lets you define the TTL in ms (default: 90000 ~ 15 minutes).                                 |
| `config:translationsCache?` | boolean  | Boolean value to disable the translation cache (default: `true`)                                                                                                           |
| `translate?`                | function | Custom translation function. You can read more about customizing translations here: Custom translations                                                                    |
