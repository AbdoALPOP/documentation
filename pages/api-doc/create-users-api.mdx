# Create users API

The createUser API is used to synchronize user data to ROQ. This data is needed for two purposes

For the creation of user-specific JWT tokens. These tokens are used for secure interaction between your application and
ROQ. The data is also used to send emails and notifications. For instance, you may want to address your users by 
their first name in a notification template: `Hi {{recipient.firstName}}`

It’s your decision which information you wish to synchronize to ROQ. It’s recommended to send the data to ROQ after you
store it in your database.

See the API doc of [createUser](https://snapshotp.roq-platform.com/docs/#mutation-createUser)

```text
userData: {
  reference: "123",
  email: "john@doe.tech",
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  isOptedIn: true,
  active: true,
  locale: "en-US"
} 

const { id: roqIdentifier } = platform.user.createUser(userData);
```
You need to save the returned ID in your database because the API needs it.
