# Using the SDK

## Introduction

ROQ provides an SDK for Node.js applications, simplifying the API's usage but still allowing you to use GraphQL
queries and mutations if needed.

## Installation and configuration

You can install the SDK using this NPM command:

```shell
npm i --save @roq/nodejs
```

Then you can create an instance of the `Platform` class and provide the required configuration:

<Tabs items={['Node.js SDK']}><Tab>

```typescript
import {Platform} from '@roq/nodejs';

const client = new Platform({
    environmentId: 'abc',
    apiKey: 'abc',
    jwtSecret: 'abc',
    host: 'abc',
});
```

</Tab></Tabs>

All the credentials can be retrieved from the [console](https://console.roq.tech/). 

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
The credentials must not be shared with anyone. It's highly recommended to provide the credentials as environment 
variables and don't commit them into your repository. 
</Callout>


| Parameter     | Type   | Description                                                            |
|---------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| environmentId | string | ID of your ROQ Platform environment.                                   |
| apiKey        | string | Secure key that protects the server-side interaction with ROQ Platform |
| jwtSecret     | string | The secret word which is used to validate JWT tokens on your side      |
| host          | string | The URL of ROQ Platform                                                |

## User vs SuperAdmin

When you interact with ROQ Platform, you need a user token. A user is usually available on the client side so that
you  can use its token. But in some cases, there is no user token available. For instance, when you implement logic
that  is executed as a cron job. For these scenarios, ROQ provides a special user called "super admin". This
user has full permissions, so we recommend using it carefully.

The super admin user is always available on ROQ Platform side and isn't shown in the console. For 
security reasons it can only be used from the server side of your application.

If you prefer to interact with the current user ID then you can use the `asUser` function and provide the user's ID. 
Whenever a user is available, then it should be used.

<Tabs items={['Node.js SDK']}><Tab>
```typescript
await client.asUser(userId).sendMail(...)
```
</Tab></Tabs>

To interact with ROQ Platform using the super admin user, you can use the `asSuperAdmin` function:

<Tabs items={['Node.js SDK']}><Tab>
```typescript
await client.asSuperAdmin().sendMail(...)
```
</Tab></Tabs>

## Example: sending mails

The following snipped shows the full example how to send mails using the service account user. Please refer to the 
[Mails API](/api-doc/mails-api) documentation for more details. The credentials are injected via environment variables.

<Tabs items={['Node.js SDK']}><Tab>
```typescript
import { Platform } from '@roq/nodejs';

const client = new Platform({
  environmentId: env.environmentId,
  apiKey: env.apiKey,
  jwtSecret: env.jwtSecret,
  host: env.host,
});

await client.asSuperAdmin().sendMail({
  mail: { 
      key: 'abc123', 
      locale: 'abc123', 
      emails: ['xyz789'], 
      data: [{ key: 'xyz789', value: 'xyz789' }]
  },
});
```
</Tab></Tabs>

## Example: fetching data

The following snipped fetches 10 users from ROQ Platform and loads their emails into a variable.

<Tabs items={['Node.js SDK']}><Tab>
```typescript
const response = await client.asUser(userId).users({ 
    limit: 10, 
    offset: 0, 
    filter: { locale: { equalTo: 'en' } 
    } 
});
const users = response.users.data;
const emails = users.map((user) => user.email);
```
