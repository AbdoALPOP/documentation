# Change visibility of a file

A file can be either public or private. Public means that there is a permanent URL which can be used by anyone, while
private files can only be accessed by user who are allowed to do so. The visibility of a file can be changed in the
console or via API using the `makeFilePublic()` and `makeFilePrivate()` methods.

## makeFilePublic()

To hide a file from public access, you can execute:

<Tabs items={['GraphQL']}><Tab> 
```graphql
mutation makeFilePublic($fileId: ID!) {
  makeFilePublic(fileId: $fileId) {
    id
  }
}
```
</Tab></Tabs>

## makeFilePrivate()

To enable public access to a file, run:

<Tabs items={['GraphQL']}><Tab>
```graphql
mutation makeFilePrivate($fileId: ID!) {
  makeFilePrivate(fileId: $fileId) {
    id
  }
}
```
</Tab></Tabs>
