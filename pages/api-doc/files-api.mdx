# Files API

## Introduction

ROQ provides a complete solution for management of public and private files. Please read the
[files feature guide](/feature-guides/files) for all information.

## files()

You can get a list of files using the `files()` query.

**Access management:** The query returns all files that are accessible for the
current user.

**Associations:** You can use the filters to find files which are associated with other objects;
see [createFileAssociation()](#createfileassociation). The typical flow looks loke this: First, you fetch the ID of an
object from your database and then query the related
files. For instance, the query shown below requests all files that are associated with a specific _"contract"_.

**Visibility:** For files marked as _“public”_, the returned URL is static. If the file is marked as _“private”_, then
the
URL is
referred to as a signed URL which is created for only one purpose. A signed URL works only for a short amount of time
and is not intended to be published.

{/* TODO Does files return a signed URL if the fiel is private */}

{/* TODO entityIdentifiers will be renamed to entityReferences */}

<Tabs items={['GraphQL']}><Tab>

```graphql
query {
  files(filter: {
    entityName: {
      equalTo: "contract"
    },
    entityIdentifiers: {
      equalTo:"123"
    }}) {
    data {
      id
      name
      contentType
      url
      isPublic
    }
  }
}
```

</Tab></Tabs>

| Parameter           | Type   | Description                                                                                 |
|---------------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `entityName`        | object | Name of the object. This could be the name of the table in your database, e.g. _"contract"_ |
| `entityIdentifiers` | object | References (or IDs) of the related objects from your database                               |

{/* TODO entityIdentifiers will be renamed to entityReferences */}

## file()

To download a single file, you can use the `file()` query.

<Tabs items={['GraphQL']}><Tab>

```graphql
query {
  file(fileId: "123") {
    id
    name
    url
    isPublic
  }
}
```

</Tab></Tabs>

## createFileUpload()

To upload file via API you need to proceed the following steps. However, it's recommended to use ROQ's [File Upload UI
component](/ui-components/file-upload) instead of building it yourself.

1. Generate a signed URL using the `createFileUpload()` API
2. Upload file via the signed URL
3. Set status of the file using the `updateFileStatus()` API

The `createFileUpload` API returns a "signed URL" which is then used to upload the file directly from the user's browser
to the object storage.

{/* TODO Name of variable createFileDto will be changed to file  */}
{/* TODO add a real content type  */}

<Tabs items={['GraphQL']}><Tab>

```graphql
mutation {
  createFileUpload(
    file: {
      name: "abc123"
      contentType: "image/png"
      fileCategory: "xyz789"
    }
  ) {
    id
    uploadUrl
  }
}

```

</Tab></Tabs>

| Parameter      | Type   | Description                                                                               |
|----------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`         | string | Name of the uploaded file                                                                 |
| `contentType`  | string | Mime type of the file, see [here](https://mimetype.io/all-types/) for a list of all types |
| `fileCategory` | string | `Key` of the category of the file                                                         |

With the returned URL you can upload the file, for instance using curl:

```shell
curl 'https://s3.fr-par.scw.cloud/<bucket-name>' \
  -H 'authority: s3.fr-par.scw.cloud' \
  -H 'accept: application/json, text/plain, */*' \
  -H 'accept-language: en-US,en;q=0.9' \
  -H 'content-type: image/png' \
  -H 'sec-fetch-mode: cors' \
  -H 'sec-fetch-site: cross-site' \
  --data-raw $'---REMOVED---' \
  --compressed
```

When the upload is finished, you need to set the status of the upload. This is needed because the file is uploaded
directly to the object storage and therefore bypasses ROQ Platform.

<Tabs items={['GraphQL']}><Tab>

```graphql
mutation{
  updateFileStatus(
    fileId: "123",
    status: READY
  ){
    id
  }
}
```

</Tab></Tabs>

## createFileAssociation()

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  This endpoint is only available from the server side of your application. 
</Callout>

Files usually belong to some other object. For instance, you may have PDFs which represent _"contracts"_. Or you may
have images which are _"avatars"_ and so on. To simplify this, ROQ enables you to relate files with objects which are
saved on your database. The advantage is that you don't need to add these relations to your own database.

{/* TODO rename parameter createFileAssociationDto to createFileAssociationDto */}

<Tabs items={['GraphQL']}><Tab>

```graphql
mutation {
  createFileAssociation(
    createFileAssociationDto: {
      entityReference: 4
      entityName: "xyz789"
      fileId: "4"
    }
  ) {
    id
  }
}
```

| Parameter         | Type   | Description                                                                                 |
|-------------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `fileId`          | string | UUID of the file                                                                            |                                                                          
| `entityReference` | string | Reference (or ID) of the related entity in your database                                    |
| `entityName`      | string | Name of the object. This could be the name of the table in your database, e.g. _"contract"_ |

## makeFilePublic()

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  This endpoint is only available from the server side of your application. 
</Callout>

To enable public access to a file, run:

<Tabs items={['GraphQL']}><Tab>

```graphql
mutation makeFilePublic($fileId: ID!) {
  makeFilePublic(fileId: $fileId) {
    id
  }
}
```

</Tab></Tabs>

## makeFilePrivate()

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  This endpoint is only available from the server side of your application. 
</Callout>

To hide a file from public access, you can execute:

<Tabs items={['GraphQL']}><Tab>

```graphql
mutation makeFilePrivate($fileId: ID!) {
  makeFilePrivate(fileId: $fileId) {
    id
  }
}
```

</Tab></Tabs>
