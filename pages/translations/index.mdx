# Custom translations

## Introduction

All UI components can be translated into any language. The translated texts can be managed via ROQ Console or your
existing translation system.

## Managing translations

Translations are managed via [ROQ Console](https://console.roq.tech/). All components are already translated. Therefore
you can find the translated texts and change them to your needs. Changes will be shown in the UI
components after a few minutes because of the browser's caching system.

## Managing locales

You can manage locales in [ROQ Console](https://console.roq.tech/). When you add a new locale, then you'll need to add
missing translations to all texts. You cannot remove a locale as long as there are translated texts using this locale.

## Technical integration

The current locale needs to be set to the `<RoqProvider/>` wrapper as
described [here](/translations/custom-translations#loading-translations-in-code). In case you want to use your existing 
translation
system, please refer to the [custom translation](/translations/custom-translations) section.
