# Custom translations

## Introduction

All UI components can be translated into any language. The translated texts can be managed via ROQ's console or your
existing translation system. Please refer to the [translations feature guide](/notifications) for more 
information and instructions.

## Loading translations in code

Locales are defined as a prop of `<RoqProvider>`. If no locale is defined, then `en-US` will be used as the default
locale.

```tsx
<RoqProvider locale="de-DE">

</RoqProvider>
```

The `<RoqProvider>` fetches translations from ROQ Platform every five minutes. The data is cached in the user's browser.

## Custom translation provider

If you are already using a translation system, you can pass a function that takes over the translation.

```tsx
return (
    <RoqProvider translation={myTranslation}>
        {Story()}
    </RoqProvider>
);
```
