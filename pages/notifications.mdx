# Notifications

## Introduction

ROQ's notifications enable you to notify your users or user groups on various channels:

* In-app notifications, loaded in real-time using a socket connection directly from your web app using
  the [Notification Modal](/notifications/notification-modal) UI component.
* notifications via SMS or push messages to the mobile phones of your users
* chat systems like Slack and Discord
* and traditional e-mails.

Users can define their preferences for every type of notification. For instance, alerts can be retrieved via push
message, while product updates are delivered via e-mail.

Please look at the [mail feature](/mails) if you want to send a transactional email to someone who isn't a user yet.

{/* NOTE - Unsubscribe is not implemented yet */}

## Installation

To install notifications, you need to perform a few simple steps, described in the feature's [installation guide](/notifications/installation).

## UI components

ROQ's notification feature ships with two main UI components that you can easily integrate into your application:

1. The [**Notification Modal**](/notifications/notification-modal) component shows the user's notifications in
   real-time and also enables the user to configure the preferences.
2. The [**Notification Bell**](/notifications/notification-bell) component renders a bell symbol which informs the
   user about unread notifications.

## APIs

The notification API enables you to notify users of our application. Check out the docs [here](/notifications/api).
