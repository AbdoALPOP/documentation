# User groups

## Introduction

We usually interpret a user group as precisely what the name says: _“a group of users”_. For example, you may want to
group users by their home country or any other characteristic.

User groups are used for [notifications](/notifications). Instead of listing all users, you can set one
or multiple groups of users.

## Manage user groups

You can manage user groups via [console](https://console.roq.tech/)
or [`createUserGroup()`](/user-groups/api#createusergroup) API. A user group has a **name** (e.g. _“The 
Mavericks”_
or _“The Gourmet Kitchen”_). In addition, you can define a project-specific **reference** that enables you to fetch user
groups using your identifier.

## Add and remove users

You can add and remove users from a user group in the [console](https://console.roq.tech/) or use the
[`addUsersToUserGroup()`](/user-groups/api#adduserstousergroup) API. Group memberships are also shown for each
user in the console.
