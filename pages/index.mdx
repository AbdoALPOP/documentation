## What is ROQ about?

ROQ is based on the observation that most modern SaaS applications have the same main features. Although these
commodities alone won't make you unique, users still expect them, so you should offer them early. The challenge is that
these commodities are hard to implement and could easily waste your time and engineering capacity.

ROQ solves this challenge by offering ready-to-use UI components and APIs for all essential features you need to build
your SaaS application: authentication, authorization, user management, a [real-time chat](feature-guides/chat),
[notifications](feature-guides/notifications), [file management](feature-guides/files), and many more.

## How does ROQ work?

ROQ consists of two main parts: **Functional UI Components** and a **Headless ROQ Platform** 

### Functional UI Components

ROQ provides a set of **fully-functional and highly customizable UI components** that you can easily integrate into your
application.

### Headless ROQ Platform
ROQ Platform represents the backend for the UI components. In addition, ROQ Platform provides
GraphQL APIs that you can leverage to build your custom logic.
