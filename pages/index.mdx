## What is ROQ about?

ROQ provides fundamental features that every web application needs, like user & access management, file handling, and
notifications. It enables teams to focus on their unique features instead of building the basic functionalities
repeatedly.

Usually a feature consits of different elements:
- When using a ROQ feature, you can use our **React UI Components** and drag these into your app. You can adjust the styling
and options to your needs, so it looks like a seamless experience to your users.
- Behind the scenes, the UI components use out **GraphQL APIs** (or socket connection for Chat). With the APIs you can trigger commands
(e.g. sending a notification), seamlessly integrate data into your own app (e.g. for user management), or even build your own UI 
components.
- You can configure the behavior and business logic, as well as connect external tools and integrations, by using **ROQ Console**
- Behind the scenes, **ROQ Platform** is our own application contains all business logic, persistance layer etc.

For security reasons, only our authentication feature ROQ Auth works differently: You can completely style it in ROQ Console and it
is operated by us.

{/* ROQ is based on the observation that most modern SaaS applications have the same main features. Although these
commodities alone won't make you unique, users still expect them, so you should offer them early. The challenge is that
these commodities are hard to implement and could easily waste your time and engineering capacity. */}

## How does ROQ work?

ROQ consists of two main parts: **Functional UI Components** and a **Headless ROQ Platform**

### Functional UI Components

ROQ provides a set of **fully-functional and highly customizable UI components** that you can easily integrate into your
application.

### Headless ROQ Platform

ROQ Platform represents the backend for the UI components. In addition, ROQ Platform provides
GraphQL APIs that you can leverage to build your custom logic.
