## What is ROQ about?

ROQ represents a set of typical features of SaaS applications, like user & access management, file handling, and
notifications. It enables teams to focus on their unique features instead of building the basic functionalities
repeatedly. ROQ can be integrated into any web-based application using fully-functional UI components and a GraphQL API.
Because of its multi-tenant approach, it perfectly suits B2B as well as B2C scenarios.

{/* ROQ is based on the observation that most modern SaaS applications have the same main features. Although these
commodities alone won't make you unique, users still expect them, so you should offer them early. The challenge is that
these commodities are hard to implement and could easily waste your time and engineering capacity. */}

ROQ's features are provided as fully-functional UI components and APIs for all essential features you need to build
your SaaS application:
authentication, [access management](/feature-guides/access-management), [user management](/feature-guides/users),
a [real-time chat](feature-guides/chat), [notifications](feature-guides/notifications), [file management](feature-guides/files),
and many more.

## How does ROQ work?

ROQ consists of two main parts: **Functional UI Components** and a **Headless ROQ Platform**

### Functional UI Components

ROQ provides a set of **fully-functional and highly customizable UI components** that you can easily integrate into your
application.

### Headless ROQ Platform

ROQ Platform represents the backend for the UI components. In addition, ROQ Platform provides
GraphQL APIs that you can leverage to build your custom logic.
