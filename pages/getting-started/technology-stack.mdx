# Technology stack

## Technologies used

ROQ's app generator builds a fully-functional application based on your input (
see [how it works](/getting-started/how-it-works)). The resulting application follows the best practices of the
underlying frameworks. If you are familiar with them, there won't be any surprises.

* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
* [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)
* [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/)
* ROQ UI Components and APIs (see below)

## Hosting

It can be easily deployed to any PaaS solution like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [Render](https://render.com/),
[Scalingo](https://scalingo.com/) and connected to a database system that is supported by Prisma, like Postgres, MongoDB
and many more.

## ROQ UI Components and APIs

The application uses ROQ's functional React components and APIs, which enrich your application with functionality like user- and access
management, notifications, chat, and more. 

The integration is realized by the [@roq/nextjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@roq/nextjs) library which ships with 
multiple React Components and an API client.
