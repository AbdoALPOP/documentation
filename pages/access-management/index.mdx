# Access Management

## Introduction

Access management in SaaS applications refers to controlling who can access the application and what actions they can
perform. This is achieved through roles and permissions, which grant different access levels to other users.

With ROQ's access management, you can:

* define roles and assign them to your users
* setup permissions and enforce them on your application.

## What are roles and permissions?

### Roles

Roles are assigned directly to users. You can easily read them in sentences like this:

* _User Mary is an admin_
* _User Jane is a chef_
* _User John is a driver_
* _User Richard is a customer_

A **role** is represented by its name. For example, you may define a role called _owner_ and another role called
_member_. You can also be more specific and use whatever term makes sense in your business, like a _manager_, _chef_,
_driver_, or
_customer_.

### Permissions

**Permissions** define access to a specific type of object. For instance, you specify that the role _manager_ has read
access to
the sales orders of a restaurant management application.

Each permission consists of:

* the restricted entity, like `sales_order`
* an operation, like `read`, `create`, `update`, or `delete`
* and a scope, like `all`, `own`, or `tenant`

## How it works

Roles and permissions are defined in the [ROQ Console](https://console.roq.tech/). Generally, permissions grant access
to objects, e.g., _a customer is allowed to make an order_. You can specify the operation (read, create, update, and
delete) and set the scope. The scope determines if a user has access to either `all` records, only the `own` records, or to records related to the own account (~ `tenant`).
These permissions are automatically enforced on all UI Components and APIs of ROQ and can also be applied on the project's user interface and queries.

Some steps of preparation are needed. First, you must declare your custom domain objects with relations in ROQ Console
and define your permissions based on these objects.

Technically, the access management works based on a query plan which ROQ computes based on the current user's
permissions and your database tables. The SDK is caching this information locally and only refreshes it
periodically. This way, your application is independent of the availability of the ROQ Platform. Furthermore, there is
no need to send all your data. ROQ only needs to know the schema of your database; the actual queries will be performed
on your side.

You can use two functions of the SDK in your project: `hasAccess` and `buildQueryPlan`

## Check if a user has access to an object.

The `hasAccess` method returns `true` if a user has access to something; otherwise false.
You can use it for any object, whether it's an entity from your database, a URL, or a user interface component.
See `hasAccess` SDK for more details.

## Filter down data of a query

When you retrieve data from your database, you'll often need to filter it by the user's role. For example, let’s say you
have a REST endpoint called `/rented-cars` which returns a list of rented cars. Depending on the user's role, the
result will be different: an _admin_ will see all the rented cars, while a _customer_ will see only their
rented cars. This can result in complicated WHERE conditions, especially if you have more than these two simple roles.

For this scenario, ROQ provides a query builder that automatically creates the required conditions. Using our ORM
adapter, this can be easily integrated into your project. The generated queries can become quite complex if you have a
deep schema. You can read more details about this method here: `buildQueryPlan` SDK

## Project's permissions

To define permission for your own application, you need to select an object type (e.g., `salesOrder`). If you don't find
the required object in the dropdown, then it wasn't declared in the preparation. 

For each object, you can set the access level:

| Level    | Description                                                 |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Read`   | The user is allowed to retrieve objects                     |
| `Create` | Enables the user to create new objects of the selected type |
| `Update` | Enables the user to update objects of the selected type     |
| `Delete` | Enables the user to delete objects of the selected type     |

[//]: # (In addition, you can define the scope:)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (| Scope      | Description                               |)

[//]: # (|------------|-------------------------------------------|)

[//]: # (| All        | The user is allowed to access all records |)

[//]: # (| Restricted | A given path restricts the access         |)

[//]: # (| Restricted | A given path restricts the access         |)

[//]: # (The **path** defines the correct way from one database table to another. For example, the path always starts at the)

[//]: # (table representing the user &#40;often, this table is called user &#41;. From here, you can select other tables that are)

[//]: # (related until you reach the table that holds objects of the selected type. For instance, a path to a sales order)

[//]: # (object could look like this: `user → salesOrder`. A path from a user to an order item could look like)

[//]: # (this: `user -> salesOrder -> salesOrderItem`)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (The console will automatically set this information if the path is clear. You only need to adopt it if there are)

[//]: # ([//]: # &#40;multiple paths in your schema.&#41;)
[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Your custom database schema only defines these paths. Instead, ROQ uses them to build the query plan, which is then used)

[//]: # (to add WHERE conditions to your database queries.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (*/})

## ROQ Platform permissions

Permissions that are applied on ROQ's side are defined similarly.
Scopes:

| Scope    | Description                                                               |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `All`    | The user is allowed to access all records                                 |
| `Own`    | The access is restricted to records that are directly related to a user   |
| `Tenant` | The access is restricted to records that are related to the user's tenant |
