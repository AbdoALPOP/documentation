# User invites

## Introduction

Especially in B2B SaaS applications, users are expected to invite other users into the same tenant. This feature is
essential for projects who charge "per seat". ROQ ships with a complete solution for user invites, which you can use
together with [authentication](/authentication).

## UI Components

ROQâ€™s user invite provides multiple UI components which can be integrated into your application:

1. The [**`<The UserInvitesTable />`**](/user-invites/user-invites-table) is an
   advanced component that handles the entire logic at once.
2. UserInvitePane
3. UserInviteButton
