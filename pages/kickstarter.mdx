# Kickstarter for new projects

The open-source Kickstarter is the perfect starting point for your next project! It fully integrates with all
of ROQ's features. Therefore, you don't need to care about logins, social sign-ins, registration, invites,
notifications, etc.

The Kickstarter ships with documented clean code. The styling is based on a single CSS file, so you can choose 
whatever CSS-library you prefer.
