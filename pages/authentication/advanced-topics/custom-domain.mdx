## Use custom domain

For production environments, it's often required to use a custom domain like auth.myproject.com instead of ROQ's default
URLs. To change the domain, you need to:

1. Login to [console](https://console.roq.tech/) and go to `Authentication` ➔ `URLs` ➔ `Custom Domain`
2. Copy the `CNAME`, go to your domain registrar (e.g. Godaddy) and set your DNS records
3. Wait a few minutes until this change takes effect, then enter the custom domain and press the `verify` button.
4. Configure the new URL using the `ROQ_AUTH_URL` variable
