# Notification Modal UI component

## Overview

## Integration

{/* TODO Props are not aligned with the actual UI component. */}

You can integrate the component like this:

```tsx
<NotificationModal/>
```

Technically the component will open a socket connection to ROQ Platform, which informs about new notifications in real
time, which will then be fetched using the [Fetch notifications API]().

In most cases, no configuration is needed but you can fine-tune the behavior with these props:

| Prop               | Type   | Description                                         | Default           |
|--------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| `pollInterval`     | number | Interval to reset all fetched notifications (in ms) | `900000` (15 min) |
| `bodyHeightScroll` | number | Height at which scrolling starts                    | `null` (endless)  |

Besides these props, you can inject any React component for styling purposes; see the styling guide
{/* TODO */}

If you want to react to internal events, you can use one of these
callbacks: `onChangeType`,  `onFetchNotificationsSuccess`  and  `onReceiveUnseenCountChanged`.
