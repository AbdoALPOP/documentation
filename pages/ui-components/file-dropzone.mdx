# File Dropzone UI component

## Introduction

{/* TODO Add screenshot */}

The `<FileDropZone />` component represents an area on your application where users can drag and drop files to be
uploaded. The dropzone typically appears as a highlighted area or box on the screen, and users can drag files from their
computer and drop them into the designated area. Once the files are dropped, they will begin to upload to the website or
application. This can be a convenient and user-friendly way to upload files, especially if the user has multiple files
to upload at once.

[See this component on Storybook]()

## Integration

You can easily add the `<FileDropZone />` component to your application by using this code:

```tsx
<FileDropZone
    accept={[
        'image/*',
        'application/pdf',
        'application/m*'
    ]}
    fileAssociationOptions={[]}
    fileCategory="USER_FILES"
    onUploadFail={function noRefCheck() {
    }}
    onUploadSuccess={function noRefCheck() {
    }}
/>
```
