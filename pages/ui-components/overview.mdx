# UI Components overview

## Introduction

ROQ UI Components are plug and play widgets that are fully wired up to the ROQ platform APIs.
They are fully functional, and add functionality to your application within just a few lines of code.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  At the moment, ROQ's UI components are available for React only. However, if you need support for other libraries 
like Vue.js or Angular, don't hesitate to contact us on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/roq-community/shared_invite/zt-1ly20yqpg-K03kNGxN1C7G1C0rr3TlSQ).

## Installation

To get started with integrating ROQ UI, you need to wrap your React application into the [`<RoqProvider/>`](/ui-components/roq-provider).

## Available UI Components

These UI Components are ready to be used in your project!

### Chat
* The [`<Chat/>`](/ui-components/chat) UI component represents the chat message center with sidebar and the chat window.
* The [`<ChatMessageBell/>`](/ui-components/chat-message-bell) component informs the user about unread messages in the chat.

### Files
* The [`<FileUpload/>`](/ui-components/file-upload) component represents an area on your application where users can drag and drop files to be uploaded.
* The [`<FileActiveUploads/>`](/ui-components/file-active-uploads) component shows a progress bar of all active files uploads.

* The [`<NotificationBell/>`](/ui-components/notification-bell) component renders a bell symbol which informs the user about unread notifications
* The [`<NotificationModal/>`](/ui-components/notification-modal) component shows the user's notifications in real-time and also enables the user to configure the preferences.
