# Getting Started with ROQ UI Components

## Introduction

ROQ UI Components are plug and play widgets that are fully wired up to the ROQ platform APIs.
They are fully functional, and add functionality to your application within just a few lines of code.

### Installation

To get started with integrating ROQ UI, you need to first install the module that matches your technology.
The `<ChatMessageBell />` requires the [`<Chat/>`](/ui-components/chat) component to be used as well.

    ##### Install the ROQ UI React npm module 
    
    ``` npm install @roq/ui-react ```

    ##### Configure the ROQ Provider
    Insert the `<RoqProvider>` at a high-level component in your code. Typically this is an `App.tsx` or a layout component.
    The `<RoqProvider>` provides the configuration and context for the inner ROQ UI components to consume.
    It needs to be imported and used only once.

    If you are using the [`<Chat/>`](/ui-components/chat) UI Components, then also ensure to add the `<ChatProvider>` component
    at a suitable level of your code.


    ``` tsx
      import { RoqProvider, ChatProvider } from "@roq/ui-react";

      ...

      function MyApp() {
        return (
          <RoqProvider
            config={{
              // The host varies for different environments
              // You can get the host from your ROQ Console https://console.roq.tech
              host: "https://<your-environment-host>.roq-platform.com/v01/graphql"
              // The token is the ROQ auth token, generated for your user from your server-side at login
              // Ensure that this token is valid, and not expired
              token: "Your ROQ user authentication token"
              socket: true // Set to true if you use chat or notifications
            }}
            themeMode={colorMode}
            theme={roqTheme}
          >
            <ChatProvider>
              {/* your app components */}
              {/* ROQ components can now be used anywhere inside this context */}
            </ChatProvider>
          </RoqProvider>
        );
      }

      ...
    ```
