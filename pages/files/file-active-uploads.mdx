# File Active Uploads UI component

## Introduction

The `<FileActiveUploads/>` component shows a progress bar of all active files uploads. Users can abort and restart
uploads. This component is typically shown on the bottom right corner of your application but you can place it wherever
you like.

[See this component on Storybook]()
